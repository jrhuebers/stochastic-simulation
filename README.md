# stochastic-simulation
Coursework for the module _Stochastic Simulation_, which covered simulation methods ranging from basic random variate generation to advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. The coursework consisted of Python programming tasks using NumPy and matplotlib, with accompanying short reports analyzing the results.

__Coursework 1__: 
- Q1: Implements a rejection sampler of the chi^2 distribution.
- Q2: Implements a sampler of a mixed density built out of three inverse transform samplers.

__Coursework 2__:
- Q1: Monte Carlo integration and importance sampling.
- Q2: Sampling using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
  
__Coursework 3__:
- Q1: Implements a simple Markov chain.
- Q2 part 1: Simulates a Gaussian time series corrupted by noise.
- Q2 part 2: Simulates a stochastic volatility model for stock prices.
